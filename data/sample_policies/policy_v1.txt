COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY
Version 1.0 - Effective January 1, 2024

PREAMBLE

This Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy is entered into between Acme Insurance Company ("the Insurer") and the Named Insured as specified in the Declarations. This policy provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability arising from the Named Insured's business operations, subject to the terms, conditions, and exclusions set forth herein.

SECTION 1: COVERAGE LIMITS

The Insurer agrees to pay on behalf of the Named Insured all sums that the Named Insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage covered by this policy.

Coverage Limits:
- General Aggregate Limit: $2,000,000
- Products-Completed Operations Aggregate: $2,000,000
- Personal and Advertising Injury Limit: $1,000,000
- Each Occurrence Limit: $500,000
- Fire Damage Limit (Any one fire): $100,000
- Medical Expense Limit (Any one person): $10,000

The limits shown above are the most we will pay regardless of the number of insureds, claims made, or persons or organizations making claims.

SECTION 2: DEDUCTIBLE PROVISIONS

A deductible of $5,000 applies to each separate claim or occurrence. The deductible shall be paid by the Named Insured and applies to each separate claim incident. The deductible is not part of the policy limits and must be satisfied before the Insurer's obligation to pay arises.

The Named Insured is responsible for payment of the deductible directly to the claimant or service provider. The Insurer may, at its discretion, advance payment on behalf of the Named Insured and subsequently seek reimbursement.

SECTION 3: COVERAGE TERRITORY

This insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage that occurs within the coverage territory, which includes:

a) The United States of America (including its territories and possessions)
b) Puerto Rico
c) Canada

Coverage is provided only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period and is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory.

SECTION 4: EXCLUSIONS

This insurance does not apply to:

a) Expected or Intended Injury: Bodily injury or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the Named Insured.

b) Contractual Liability: Liability assumed under any contract or agreement, except for liability that the Named Insured would have in the absence of the contract.

c) Liquor Liability: Bodily injury or property damage for which any insured may be held liable by reason of causing or contributing to the intoxication of any person, or furnishing alcoholic beverages to a person under legal drinking age.

d) Workers Compensation: Any obligation of the Named Insured under workers compensation, disability benefits, or unemployment compensation law.

e) Employer's Liability: Bodily injury to an employee of the Named Insured arising out of and in the course of employment.

f) Pollution: Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual, alleged, or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape of pollutants.

g) Aircraft, Auto, or Watercraft: Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, or entrustment to others of any aircraft, auto, or watercraft owned or operated by the Named Insured.

h) Professional Services: Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the rendering of or failure to render professional services.

SECTION 5: CLAIMS NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

The Named Insured must notify the Insurer as soon as practicable of any occurrence that may result in a claim. Written notice must be provided within 60 days of the occurrence or as soon as practicable thereafter.

The notice should include:
- Name and address of the Named Insured
- Date, time, and place of the occurrence
- Names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses
- Nature and location of any injury or damage

Failure to provide timely notice may result in denial of coverage if the Insurer's rights are materially prejudiced by the delay.

SECTION 6: DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT

The Insurer has the right and duty to defend any suit seeking damages covered by this policy, even if the allegations are groundless, false, or fraudulent. The Insurer may investigate and settle any claim or suit at its discretion.

Defense costs are paid in addition to the policy limits. The Insurer's obligation to defend ends when the applicable limit of insurance has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.

The Named Insured must cooperate with the Insurer in the investigation, defense, and settlement of any claim or suit.

SECTION 7: PREMIUM AND PAYMENT TERMS

The annual premium for this policy is specified in the Declarations and is due on the policy inception date. Premium payments may be made in quarterly installments upon request and approval by the Insurer.

Late payments are subject to a 5% penalty if not received within 15 days of the due date. Failure to pay the premium when due may result in cancellation of the policy.

SECTION 8: CANCELLATION AND NON-RENEWAL

The Named Insured may cancel this policy at any time by providing written notice to the Insurer. The Insurer will return any unearned premium on a pro-rata basis.

The Insurer may cancel this policy by providing 30 days written notice to the Named Insured for non-payment of premium, or 60 days written notice for any other reason permitted by law.

SECTION 9: GENERAL CONDITIONS

Inspection and Audit: The Insurer has the right to inspect the Named Insured's operations and records at any time during the policy period and for three years thereafter.

Assignment: This policy may not be assigned without the written consent of the Insurer.

Subrogation: If the Insurer makes any payment under this policy, the Insurer is subrogated to the Named Insured's rights of recovery against any third party.
